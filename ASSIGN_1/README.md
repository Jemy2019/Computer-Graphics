# Different Shapes using GLUT and simple Math


the idea based on using only one function to build any shape is: 
	
	any regular Shape consists of multiple identicals triangles.

# Output for shapes from 3 - 10 polygons.

	we can also use the same function with large number of sides to shape a circle.
